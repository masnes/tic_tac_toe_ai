    # Warning: This is the most complex function in this program!
    #
    # a diagram of a tic tac toe board is most helpful for understanding the
    # diagonal traversing part of this function (by far the most complex part).
    # The following applies for any board size, but is best illustrated by a
    # 3x3 board:
    #
    #    0  1  2 (j)
    #  0__|__|__
    #  1__|__|__
    #  2  |  |
    # (i)
    #
    # Note that we have 5 diagonals going each direction (count them. Only
    # found 3? That's because we count diagonals of length 1 too. See diagrams
    # below if this is confusing). For a board size of lxl (with l representing
    # length), there's (l*2)-1 diagonals.
    #
    # For the down-left diagonals (We'll get to the other direction later):
    #
    # We can think of the first 3 (l) diagonals as starting at locations
    # a[0][?]
    #
    # let #'s (numbers, eg. 1, 2, 3) represent diagonals
    # let s# stand for the start of diagonal #
    #
    # direction
    # v       starting column is not determinate
    #  \       v  v  v
    #   \     s3|s2|s1 <- starting row is determinate
    #    \    __|_3|_2
    #     v     |  | 3
    #
    # and the rest starting at a[0][?]
    #
    #   starting column is determinate
    #   v
    #  __|__|__
    #  s4|__|__ < starting row
    #  s5| 4|   < is not
    #
    # given a starting row, and column position starting_i, starting_j,
    # we can get the rest of the diagonal by incrementing i, j from
    # starting_i, starting_j to the end of the board
    #
    # the diagonals moving the other direction are similar, but not exactly the
    # same. We need to rotate the above diagram, and then move in the other
    # direction:
    #
    #    0  1  3 (j)      v
    #  0 s5|s4|s3        /
    #    --+--+--       /  new
    #  1  4| 3|s2      /   direction
    #    --+--+--     /
    #  2  3| 2|s1    v
    # (i)
    #
    # The final thing to note is that we only look at chunks of the diagonal
    # that are n_in_a_row sized. Bigger chunks are broken up into
    # n_in_a_row sized chunks, and smaller chunks are ignored.
    #
    # Ex. For n_in_a_row = 2 on a 4x4 board. We'd break up the center
    # down right diagonal as follows (into lists represented as a, b, and c):
    #
    #    0  1  2  3 (j)
    #  0 a |  |  |
    #    --+--+--+--
    #  1   |ab|  |
    #    --+--+--+--
    #  2   |  |bc|
    #    --+--+--+--
    #  3   |  |  |c
    # (i)
    #
    # For n_in_a_row = 3 on a 4x4 board, we'd break up the down right diagonals
    # for whole board as follows,
    #    0  1  2  3 (j)
